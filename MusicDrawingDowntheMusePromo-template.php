            <p> David West's new book <em>Music: Drawing Down the Muse</em> is a survey of drawings done in situ (usually in rehearsal or soundcheck) with various musicians or groups, over the last 20 years. The idea of the series was to define what the experience of the music "felt like," and to capture the emotional dynamics of each different situation. Some of these groups still exist, and others existed for a short period of time, or were "supergroups" that were entirely a one-shot deal. The series began in San Francisco in 1990 with Monte Cazazza's "Love Force," and continued during the 90s in New York, defining an epoch and an interest in music with a narrative structure. Over the last 10 years in Paris, the focus has changed to the international – with the inclusion of many French and European musicians. From Wire to Patti Smith, from the Bush Tetras to Daniel Darc, and from Devo to Silver Apples, West has strived to express the effect of the musical charge . . . often working with musicians over several days, and with the cover of invisibility he creates . . .

            <p>“Inside this book you get portraiture vérité of bands in action. Banging away in rehearsal. The appreciative eye watching the battle of the bands as they try to navigate their way through the sometimes complicated maze of illusions, delusions and solutions of grandeur before asphyxiation and evaporation of all the notes into the air. I’m the wrong person to comment on rehearsal as I work in a more backward way. I don’t care if a performance is anally-retentive-perfect because a computer can do that now. I’ll work hard on something to a point then I stop, as what I want surprises myself, especially in a live situation. It’s a viewpoint probably not shared by most of the bands in this book but that’s what makes things interesting. It’s up to others to state theirs and that takes us to the artist.

            <p>David West hits the target dead center BOOM with his beautifully liquid renderings of NYC bands in rehearsal.  Mr. West captures a scene in the late 1990s largely ignored. These aren’t vacuous American Idols but musicians who are The Real Deal. Like a fly on the wall, David gives you an inside view from his own multifaceted eye. There is a dripping aquatic fluidity to his drawings. Mr. West is not afraid to let the ink, gouache, and watercolor run and flow never betraying the nature of his medium. That’s why he’s The Real Deal. If you the viewer can’t understand, appreciate and see that in his work then go out and get corrective eye surgery!”

<p>"West reminds us of the centuries held tradition of the artists’ way of using portraiture. His work reveals the enchantment of flaws, nerves, and tension of the unbearablity of being a musician. His talent is of visual emotional representation; from eye to hand to heart. Through these works on paper- ink, guache and color pencil, we become mesmerized by the focused immersion into sound."

            <br><br>
            <p>"Before he became an urbane Parisian, I met David West in New York's still-gritty 1990s Lower East Side - where he and his astute pencil stayed up all night transposing the nocturnal subterranean adventure to paper."

            <br><br>
            <p>"From the corner of a seedy Lower East side rehearsal room, I watched David West interpret our sound and looks into a look reminiscent of 1940s grotesque. A feeling many musicians know all to well. Fascinating work."

            <p>Born in Detroit, <strong>David West</strong> lives and works in Paris. Over the past 30 years, he has repeatedly found himself at the epicentre of a number of burgeoning underground music and art scenes; first in Chicago, then New York and San Francisco.
            <p>Throughout his career David West has been in dialogue with seminal figures in the art world such as William S. Burroughs, David Wojnarowicz, Karen Finley, Tony Oursler to name just a few yet he paints with a voice that is very much his own. He came to portraiture when he moved to San Francisco in the early 80’s and recorded in vivid ink and watercolor, the artists and musicians that moved in and out of his life. A recent monograph, DAVID WEST 1989-2001 beautifully showcases this intimate and singular world.
            <p>His work has appeared in Nuke, k48, DOUBLE, PAPER, JHON, NY Press, Seconds, Extra small, No Milk Today, Rouge Gorge and countless other publications. He has also created album cover art, lithographs and etchings and his work has also been exhibited in galleries in Europe and the United States. His latest exhibitions were a two person show with San Francisco artist Donald Mitchell at Le Galerie Impaire in Paris, a one-man show at Les Voutes in Paris, and at the Klang and Kruger gallery in Berlin.</p>
